# Photographer Portfolio
 
## Personal note
First project made in HTML and CSS, made in about 10 hours.

Every photo used as placeholder is downloaded from https://www.pexels.com/ .

**The project is free for any usages**

## Usage
The user can navigate through the section of this one-page site by clicking on the header's sections.

The **portfolio** section is a drop-down menu in which the user can select the specific type of photo to navigate to; in a future version this menu will filter the photos on the main page.

The site is responsive and should be seen correctly both via computer and smartphone.
